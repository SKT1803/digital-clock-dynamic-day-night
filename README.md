# ðŸŒžðŸŒœ Digital Clock with Dynamic Day/Night Animation

This is a digital clock web app that dynamically reflects the **sun** and **moonâ€™s position** based on the real-time clock. The sky background shifts smoothly from **day to night**, with a glowing sun, fading stars, and moonlight. The speed of time can also be accelerated for demo purposes.
